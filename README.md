# simple_english_sentences_program
This program and test functions  generate sentences with three parts:  a determiner (sometimes known as an article) a noun a verb
Write a Python program named sentences.py that generates simple English sentences. 
For example:

A cat laughed.
One man eats.
The woman will think.
Some girls thought.
Many dogs run.
Many men will write

The program must include at least these four functions:

main
get_determiner
get_noun
get_verb
You may add other program functions if you want. The functions get_determiner, get_noun, and get_verb, must randomly choose a word from a list of words and return the randomly chosen word.

In addition, for this milestone assignment, you must write a file named test_senetences.py that contains three functions named as follows:

test_get_determiner
test_get_noun
test_get_verb
All the functions that you must write for this milestone assignment are described in the Steps section below.
